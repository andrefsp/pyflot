The idea behing pyflot its to provide a Python interface to the known Javascript flot_ chart library.

Not all Python developers are productive enough with Javascript to be able to create some fancy graph functionality. Pyflot tries to bring a nice and clean way to create graphs without knowing much about the final flot_ interface.
