Concept
-------

Backend developers sometimes have to work with statistics and metrics and bring that data from a server to a web page in form of a chart. 

When this  situations happens developers most times find themselves thinking on things like, which data format should they push from the server to the pages, how to catch the data in the templates and how to plot the charts, sometimes situations even gets worst when in a team there is a clear lack of javascript skills to create those fancy graph pages.

PyFlot_, appears as a shortcut for all this providing a very nice a simple way to plot graphs just by modeling it in the backend.
